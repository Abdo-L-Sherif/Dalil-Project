This is only the front end of a project called Dalil 

The project is supposed to be a website to celebrate/help disabled people (especially physically disabled people)

All you have to do it download the project 
  -go to the directory of the project 
  -run npm install
  -then npm run dev
  project will be available on [localhost](http://localhost:5173/)

This project is prepared for endpoints that I don't know of currently as I was only tasked with the front end side as part of a freelance gig 

hope it lives up to your standards dear reader!
